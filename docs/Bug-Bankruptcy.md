## What's this?

When triaging repos we periodically decide that some portion of the open issues are older,
may be stale, or may no longer be relevant for the current goals of the project. In order
for use to be able to effectively use our issues trackers, we may choose to close this
category of issues as `closed-bug-bankruptcy`.

This is not intended as a commentary of the
quality of the report, but part of our regular process to maintain good hygiene and utility
of our issue trackers.

## I think a closed issue is still relevant

If you think an issue was closed in error, please:

- comment to that effect on the issue, or
- re-open the issue, or
- open a new issue (esp. if the original issue may not fully apply anymore)

We do expect some (smaller) portion of issues closed via a bug bankruptcy to later re-open.
